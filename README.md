The article covers a wide range of topics related to SQL, MySQL, and SQL injection techniques. Key topics include:

- **SQL & Database Fundamentals:**  
  - Differences between relational (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and non-relational databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)  
  - Basic SQL commands to manage databases, tables, and data (CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER)

- **MySQL Specifics:**  
  - How to log in using the command line  
  - Creating and using databases and tables  
  - Viewing and modifying table structures (using commands like `DESCRIBE`, `SHOW TABLES`)

- **SQL Query Techniques:**  
  - Using clauses such as `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`  
  - Sorting, filtering, and updating records

- **SQL Operators:**  
  - Logical operators like AND, OR, and NOT and their impact on query results

- **SQL Injection Fundamentals:**  
  - What SQL injection is and how it exploits vulnerabilities  
  - How improper handling of user input can lead to dangerous SQL injections

- **Injection Techniques for Authentication Bypass:**  
  - Using OR injection to bypass login forms  
  - Employing comments (`--`, `#`) to ignore parts of a query

- **UNION Clause Exploitation:**  
  - How UNION is used to combine multiple SELECT statements  
  - Determining the number of columns and ensuring compatibility in injected queries

- **Database Enumeration via SQL Injection:**  
  - Using the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to list databases, tables, and columns  
  - Techniques for dumping data, such as retrieving usernames and passwords

- **Advanced Exploitation Techniques:**  
  - Reading files from the server through SQL injection  
  - Escalating privileges and further exploitation once initial access is gained

This comprehensive article serves as both an introduction to SQL basics and a detailed guide on how attackers can exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
